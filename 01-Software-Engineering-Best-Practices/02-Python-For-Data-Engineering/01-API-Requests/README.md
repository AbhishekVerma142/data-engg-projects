# ‚ùó Before you get started

If you did not complete the challenge `010103-Linux-and-Bash` on Setup Day, we strongly recommend that you return to finish it at some point throughout this unit to minimise VM costs!

# üéØ Goals

The goal of this exercise is to make some `GET` API calls via the python `requests` library

We will be using the PokeApi to access information about pokemon. Here is the [documentation](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2). We will begin with some basic calls and then move into functions which require multiple requests to get the proper information!

<br>

# 1Ô∏è‚É£ Introduction
## 1.1. Advice for writing API calls

1. Have a look at the documentation to get familiar with the different API endpoints. Let's say we wanted to look up a specific pokemon generation via an API call. We would find out how to do that here: https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2#games-section

2. Next enter the call directly into the browser so for example look up generation 1 üëá

```
https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/generation/1
```

To make the responding JSON object easier to interact with in a web browser we recommend adding an extension for [firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/jsonview/) or for [chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/json-viewer/gbmdgpbipfallnflgajpaliibnhdgobh). If you use any other browser do a google search for your browser + json viewer and you should find something similar!

3. Check that it returns what you want! üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

4. Finally convert it into python. In this example this would be to use the [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library.

```python
import requests

requests.get("https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/generation/1")
```

## 1.2. Import requests

‚ùì You need to add the requests library to the python file in `pokemon/lookup.py`!

If you get stuck checkout this [page](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/quickstart/)

Once you are done you can checkout whether it was done correctly by running the test from your terminal üíª

```bash
pytest tests/test_lookup.py::test_import_requests
```

<br>

# 2Ô∏è‚É£ Get pokemon with your first request

Now go to `lookup.py` **your goal is to complete the first function** `get_pokemon`.
So far you have the function outline

```python
def get_pokemon(limit: int = 100, offset: int = 0) -> dict:
    """Get a list of pokemon. Return a dictionary containing the results. Limit the results to `limit` and offset by `offset`"""
    pass  # YOUR CODE HERE
```

There is some important information here to help you. The *function signature* has the *parameters* and the corresponding *data types* defined. So `limit: int` means your function will accept an integer argument called limit. The `-> dict` tells you that the function should return an object of type `dict`. Finally between the `"""` just below the function signature is the *docstring* which describes the intent of the function.

‚ùì With all of the information try and code this function!

Once you think your function works you can test it with this command:

```bash
pytest tests/test_lookup.py::test_get_pokemon
```

If everything is good you will get a response similar to this üëá

```bash

=============================================================================================================== 1 passed in 0.60s ================================================================================================================
```

**If the tests have passed, move on to the next section!**

If not, try to read the message and understand why your function is not passing the test. Go back and try to update your function until it passes! Using the output of tests to write your code is a really important practice when working on a large codebase with lots of other engineers.

<br>

# 3Ô∏è‚É£ Code the other functions

‚ùì Now code the other functions inside `lookup.py`

1. Code `check_pokemon_move` which checks whether a pokemon can learn a move.
üß™ Test
```bash
pytest tests/test_lookup.py::test_check_pokemon_move
```
2. Code `get_pokemon_types` which gets all the pokemon of a given type or of two types if an optional second type is given.
üß™ Test
```bash
pytest tests/test_lookup.py::test_get_pokemon_types
```
3. Finally code the most complicated function `get_evolutions` which looks up the pokemon which either it has evolved from, to, or both!
üß™ Test
```bash
pytest tests/test_lookup.py::test_get_evolutions
```

<br>

# üèÅ Test and push your code

üöÄ Finally, to run all of the tests together:

```bash
make test
```

If they all pass, push your code and move onto the next exercise!

```bash
git add --all
git commit -m "finished pokemon api exercise"
git push origin main
```
