# 🎯 Goal and Introduction

Pandas is crucial for data engineering because it simplifies data manipulation, integration, exploration, and analysis. It offers powerful tools like DataFrames, which enable effortless cleaning, transforming, and reshaping of data. 🧹💪

Pandas seamlessly integrates multiple data sources and supports various file formats, facilitating data integration. 📂🔄

Handling missing data is made easier with pandas' methods for filling, dropping, or interpolating values. 📊🔍

The library provides statistical analysis, descriptive statistics, and data visualization functions for data exploration. 📈📉

By leveraging efficient data structures and operations, pandas improves computational speed and memory utilization. ⚡💾

Once data processing is complete, pandas allows for easy data export or integration with other tools or libraries. 📤🔧

Overall, pandas serves as a versatile tool for data engineers, boosting productivity and efficiency in their work. 🐼💻

# 0️⃣ Data

We will again use kaggle to source our data. This time we'll use this tabular [Goodreads dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohamedbakhet/amazon-books-reviews).

```bash
kaggle datasets download -d mohamedbakhet/amazon-books-reviews --unzip -p ./data
```

# 1️⃣ Pandas pipeline

We want to use pandas to build a data pipeline. We have two CSV files at the moment: `books_data.csv` and `Books_rating.csv`. The pipeline specifications are written out below. After completing Step 1 you can work in any order, more specific instructions are included in all of the functions docstring's!

1. Complete `pandas_pipeline/load.py` which loads data relevent data from an input path.
2. Complete `pandas_pipeline/best_books.py` which will generate a CSV file of the top 10 best performing books based on their average review score.
🧪 Test
```bash
pytest -k test_best_performing_books_csv
```
3. Complete `pandas_pipeline/category_distribution.py` which will generate a CSV file of the book categories distribution.
🧪 Test
```bash
pytest -k test_category_distribution_csv
```
4. Complete `pandas_pipeline/top_authors.py` which will generate a CSV of the 10 most impactful authors baset on their average score and number of reviews.
🧪 Test
```bash
pytest -k test_author_impact_analysis_csv
```
5. Complete `pandas_pipeline/review_years.py` that will calculate the average review scroes over time and save the results to a CSV file
🧪 Test
```bash
pytest -k test_review_years_csv
```

<br>

# 🏁 Finish

Once each of the functions work run the entire pipeline with:

```bash
python pandas_pipeline/pipeline.py
```

And have a look at the output!

🧪 Test all of your code with:

```bash
make test
```

And don't forget to commit and push all your code to github 🚀
